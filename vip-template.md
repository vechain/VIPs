## Overview

<!--   
  The Overview is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary of the issue being addressed. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.
  
  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the VIP solves. It should not describe how the VIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the VIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.
  
  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your VIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.
  
  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

## Specification
  
<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Test Cases
  
<!--
  This section is optional for non-Core VIPs.

  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)
  
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/vip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

## Reference Implementation
  
<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/vip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All VIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. VIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An VIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.
