# Overview
The Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm [1], or POA in short, has a non-quantifiable unpredictability, which makes it vulnerable to adaptive corruption attack. Here, we propose a per epoch VRF-based random beacon generation mechanism. This mechanism will guarantee that the leader of epoch e is unpredictable before epoch e-2 and the adversaries cannot manipulate the beacon to gain significant advantage to be selected by the leader.
