## Overview

This VIP proposes a new transaction envelope format that increases flexibility and forward compatibility for the VeChainThor blockchain. 
Inspired by Ethereum's EIP-2718, the proposal introduces a standardized envelope to encapsulate transactions, thereby enabling the coexistence of multiple transaction types without disrupting the existing infrastructure. 

In this transaction envelop model, a valid transaction is defined as `TransactionType || TransactionPayload`, and a valid receipt as `TransactionType || ReceiptPayload`, where the `TransactionType` identifies the format and the accompanying payload contains the transaction or receipt data to be further defined in future VIPs.

## Motivation

As the VeChainThor blockchain evolves, the need for new transaction features—such as advanced fee structures, enhanced cryptographic schemes, and other protocol improvements—becomes increasingly critical. 
The current single-format transaction model restricts extensibility and makes protocol upgrades challenging. By adopting a standardized transaction envelope format, the VIP aims to simplify the introduction of new transaction types while ensuring backward compatibility with existing transactions.

## Rationale

This proposal seeks to minimize disruption and maximize flexibility by adopting a modular transaction handling approach. The benefits include:
- Enabling seamless upgrades without consensus-breaking changes.
- Fostering innovation by allowing developers to experiment with new transaction types on the same network.
- Reducing the risk of network fragmentation caused by hard forks.

## Specification

### Transaction Envelope Structure
- **Envelope Format:** Each transaction is encapsulated in an envelope consisting of:
    - **Type Identifier (1 byte):** Specifies the transaction type.
    - **Payload (variable size):** Contains the serialized transaction data specific to the type.

### Type Identifier Assignment
- Type identifiers are 1-byte values, allowing up to 256 unique transaction types.
- To avoid colliding with legacy transactions, type identifier needs to be differentiated from any first byte of legacy transacion's RLP encoding, which leaves [0x0, 0x7f] as the safe range for type identifiers. For new VeChain transaction types, we will use type identifiers in the range [0x51, 0x7f] to avoid colliding with well known networks.

### Encoding and Decoding
- The envelope must include sufficient metadata to allow unambiguous decoding.
- Nodes must support parsing envelopes and dispatch transactions to the appropriate handler based on the Type Identifier.

### Validation
- Each transaction type must define its own validation rules.
- Validators must verify both the envelope and the enclosed transaction using type-specific logic.

## Test Cases

- **Mempool:** Verify that both legacy and typed transactions are accepted.
- **Minting:** Ensure that transactions are correctly included in a block.
- **Encoding:** Confirm that transactions can be properly encoded and decoded.
- **P2P:** Check that transactions are correctly shared among peers.
- **API:** Verify that transactions can be retrieved from endpoints.

## Reference Implementation

### Definitions
- The operator `||` denotes byte/byte-array concatenation.

### Transactions
As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, the transaction root in the block header **MUST** be the root hash of `patriciaTrie(rlp(Index) => Transaction)`, where:
- **Index:** The position of the transaction in the block.
- **Transaction:** Either `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or a `LegacyTransaction`.
- **TransactionType:** A positive unsigned 8-bit number between `0x51` and `0x7f` that indicates the transaction type.
- **TransactionPayload:** An opaque byte array whose interpretation depends on the `TransactionType` (to be defined in future VIPs).
- **LegacyTransaction:** Encoded as `rlp([legacyTxFields...])`.

All signatures for new transaction types **SHOULD** include the `TransactionType` as the first byte of the signed data to prevent cross-type signature reuse.

### Receipts
As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, the receipt root in the block header **MUST** be the root hash of `patriciaTrie(rlp(Index) => Receipt)`, where:
- **Index:** The position of the receipt in the block.
- **Receipt:** Either `TransactionType || ReceiptPayload` or a `LegacyReceipt`.
- **TransactionType:** A positive unsigned 8-bit number between `0x51` and `0x7f` representing the transaction type.
- **ReceiptPayload:** An opaque byte array whose interpretation depends on the `TransactionType` (to be defined in future VIPs).
- **LegacyReceipt:** Encoded as `rlp([legacyTxReceiptFields...])`.

The `TransactionType` of the receipt **MUST** match that of its corresponding transaction.

## Backwards Compatibility

- Legacy transactions remain untyped.
- Clients can differentiate transactions by inspecting the first byte:
    - Values in [0x0, 0x7f] indicate a new transaction type.
    - Values in [0xc0, 0xfe] indicate a legacy transaction.
    - The value 0xff is reserved as an extension sentinel.

## Security Considerations

The introduction of a transaction envelope format adds complexity, which may lead to:
- **Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Incorrect implementation of envelope decoding could introduce security issues.
- **Type Collisions:** Conflicts between custom and protocol-defined Type Identifiers could cause unexpected behavior.
- **Validation Errors:** Inadequate validation logic for specific transaction types could be exploited.

It is strongly recommended that any new transaction type include the Type Identifier as the first byte of the signed payload to mitigate the risk of signature compatibility across types.
