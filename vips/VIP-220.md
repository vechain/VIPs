# Overview
In this VIP, we propose a finality gadget, namely Finality with One Bit (FOB), to the existing PoA mechanism. FOB is based on a state-of-the-art consensus algorithm, Viewless BFT (VLBFT, previously called Leaderless BFT) [1].

With FOB, the transactions and blocks will achieve finality, i.e., theoretical proven absolute security, after they are confirmed for a certain period of time. Then, as its name suggests, FOB only adds an overhead of one bit per block. It is by far the simplest and most efficient finality gadget amongst all finality gadgets in Nakamoto consensus blockchains, e.g., Casper in Ethereum and Grandpa in Polkadot.
