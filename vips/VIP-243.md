## Overview

This VIP proposes implementing a dynamic fee mechanism for VeChainThor transactions, inspired by Ethereum's EIP-1559. 
It introduces a fluctuating base fee that is burned and a user-set priority fee that is paid directly to the validator proposing the block. 

The goal is to enhance network security and user experience by transitioning from a fixed-fee model to a dynamic fee model, adjusting fees based on network congestion.

## Motivation

The current fixed-fee model presents challenges in securing the network and managing congestion. By adopting a dynamic fee model, the VIP aims to:
- **Enhance Network Security:** Dynamic fee adjustments mitigate the risk of denial-of-service attacks by increasing costs during high demand.
- **Optimize Network Congestion:** A self-adjusting base fee better reflects network demand, leading to efficient resource allocation.
- **Increase Value Accrual:** Burning the base fee reduces the circulating supply of VTHO, enhancing its value.

## Rationale

### Base Fee Burning
- **VTHO Utility:** Reinforces VTHO as the sole transaction fee token on VeChainThor.
- **Inflation Counterbalance:** Helps mitigate inflation by removing tokens from circulation.
- **Validator Neutrality:** Discourages validators from manipulating the base fee for personal gain.
- **Market Integrity:** Prevents off-chain markets from undermining the fee mechanism.

## Specification

### Transaction Fee Model
The dynamic fee model consists of two components:
- **Base Fee:** A network-wide fee determined dynamically per block based on network utilization. It is burned, effectively removing VTHO from circulation. An `InitialBaseFee` is set to 10,000 gwei (0.00001 VTHO), which also serves as the minimum base fee.
- **Priority Fee:** An optional incentive paid directly to the validator for transaction inclusion. Users specify a maximum priority fee per gas unit.

Users specify the total maximum fee (`maxFeePerGas`) they are willing to pay. This value must cover both the base fee (`baseFeePerGas`) and the maximum priority fee (`maxPriorityFeePerGas`), with any unused portion returned to the user.

### Base Fee Adjustment
The base fee is adjusted dynamically based on the gas used in the previous block relative to a target gas limit:
- **Gas Used > Gas Target:** Base fee increases.
- **Gas Used < Gas Target:** Base fee decreases.
- **Gas Used = Gas Target:** Base fee remains unchanged.

The magnitude of adjustment is determined by a predefined base fee change denominator.

#### Block Header Changes
- Add `baseFeePerGas` to the block header.

#### Transaction Model Changes
- Add `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to the transaction model.

#### New Parameters
- **Elasticity Multiplier:** On VeChainThor, set to 75% to achieve a gas target per block of 30 million gas units.
- **Base Fee Change Denominator:** Set to 8, allowing a maximum increase of ~4.17% on a full block and a maximum decrease of 12.50% on an empty block.

## Test Cases

**New Fields:**
- Verify invalid scenarios, such as `maxPriorityFeePerGas` being greater than `maxFeePerGas`.

**Fee Calculations:**
- Test the base fee calculation before, during, and after fork activation.
- Validate the fee cap constraint: `effectivePriorityPrice = min(maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas - block.baseFee)`.

**Refund and Rewards:**
- Ensure that the `baseFeePerGas` is not refunded while the `effectivePriorityPrice` is correctly applied.
- Verify that the validator's reward is calculated solely from the priority fee.

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Confirm that legacy transactions are interpreted as dynamic fee transactions by setting:
    - `maxFeePerGas` equal to `gasPrice`
    - `maxPriorityFeePerGas` equal to `gasPrice`

  This approach may lead to overpayments for legacy transactions, as users will not receive refunds for the difference between the maximum fee and the gas price.

**Consensus:**
- Validate the block header before, during, and after fork activation to ensure compliance.

## Reference Implementation

```go
func ValidateBlock(block *Block) error {
    parentBlock := GetParent(block)
    parentGasTarget := parentBlock.GasLimit / ElasticityMultiplier
    parentGasLimit := parentBlock.GasLimit

    parentBaseFeePerGas := parentBlock.BaseFeePerGas
    parentGasUsed := parentBlock.GasUsed

    // check if the block used too much gas
    if block.GasUsed > block.GasLimit {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid block: too much gas used")
    }

    // check if the gas limit is at least the minimum gas limit
    if block.GasLimit < 1_000_000 {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid block: gas limit too low")
    }

    // check if the block changed the gas limit too much
    if block.GasLimit >= parentGasLimit + parentGasLimit / 1024 {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid block: gas limit increased too much")
    }
    if block.GasLimit <= parentGasLimit - parentGasLimit / 1024 {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid block: gas limit decreased too much")
    }


    // check if the base fee is correct
    var expectedBaseFeePerGas int64
    if InitialForkBlockNumber == block.Number {
        expectedBaseFeePerGas = InitialBaseFee
    } else if parentGasUsed == parentGasTarget {
        expectedBaseFeePerGas = parentBaseFeePerGas
    } else if parentGasUsed > parentGasTarget {
        gasUsedDelta := parentGasUsed - parentGasTarget
        baseFeePerGasDelta := max(parentBaseFeePerGas * gasUsedDelta / parentGasTarget / BaseFeeMaxChangeDenominator, 1)
        expectedBaseFeePerGas = parentBaseFeePerGas + baseFeePerGasDelta
    } else {
        gasUsedDelta := parentGasTarget - parentGasUsed
        baseFeePerGasDelta := parentBaseFeePerGas * gasUsedDelta / parentGasTarget / BaseFeeMaxChangeDenominator
        expectedBaseFeePerGas = max(parentBaseFeePerGas - baseFeePerGasDelta, InitialBaseFee)
    }

    if expectedBaseFeePerGas != block.BaseFeePerGas {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid block: base fee not correct")
    }

    // execute transactions and do gas accounting
    cumulativeTransactionGasUsed := int64(0)
    for _, transaction := range transactions {
        // Validate transaction
        if err := ValidateTransaction(transaction); err != nil {
            return err
        }

        signer := state.GetEnergy(transaction.From)

        signer.Energy -= transaction.Amount
        if signer.Balance < 0 {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid transaction: signer does not have enough ETH to cover attached value")
        }

        // the signer must be able to afford the transaction
        if signer.Balance < transaction.GasLimit * transaction.MaxFeePerGas {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid transaction: signer cannot afford transaction")
        }

        // ensure that the user was willing to at least pay the base fee
        if transaction.MaxFeePerGas < block.BaseFeePerGas {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid transaction: max fee lower than base fee")
        }

        // Prevent impossibly large numbers
        maxBig := new(big.Int).Exp(big.NewInt(2), big.NewInt(256), nil)
        if big.NewInt(transaction.MaxFeePerGas).Cmp(maxBig) >= 0 {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid transaction: max fee per gas too large")
        }
        if big.NewInt(transaction.MaxPriorityFeePerGas).Cmp(maxBig) >= 0 {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid transaction: max priority fee per gas too large")
        }

        // The total must be the larger of the two
        if transaction.MaxFeePerGas < transaction.MaxPriorityFeePerGas {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid transaction: max fee lower than priority fee")
        }

        // priority fee is capped because the base fee is filled first
        priorityFeePerGas := min(transaction.MaxPriorityFeePerGas, transaction.MaxFeePerGas - block.BaseFeePerGas)
        
        // signer pays both the priority fee and the base fee
        effectiveGasPrice := priorityFeePerGas + block.BaseFeePerGas
        signer.Balance -= transaction.GasLimit * effectiveGasPrice
        
        if signer.Balance < 0 {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid transaction: signer does not have enough ETH to cover gas")
        }

        gasUsed := state.ExecuteTransaction(transaction, effectiveGasPrice)
        gasRefund := transaction.GasLimit - gasUsed
        cumulativeTransactionGasUsed += gasUsed
        
        // signer gets refunded for unused gas
        signer.Balance += gasRefund * effectiveGasPrice
        
        // validator only receives the priority fee; note that the base fee is not given to anyone (it is burned)
        validatorAccount := state.GetEnergy(block.Author)
        validatorAccount.Balance += gasUsed * priorityFeePerGas
    }

    // check if the block spent too much gas transactions
    if cumulativeTransactionGasUsed != block.GasUsed {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid block: gas_used does not equal total gas used in all transactions")
    }

    // validate the rest of the block...

    return nil
}
```

## Security Considerations
* **Economic Attacks:** Analyze potential attack vectors related to base fee manipulation and priority fee bidding wars.
* **Consensus Stability:** Assess the impact of the dynamic fee model on the stability of the VeChainThor consensus mechanism.
