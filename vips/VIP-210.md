## ⚠️ SUPERSEDED ⚠️

**This standard (VIP-210) has been superseded in favour of the [ERC1155](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-1155.md) standard on Ethereum. Development and usage of VIP-210 are strongly discouraged, and existing implementations are advised to migrate to ERC1155.**

For detailed guidelines on utilizing ERC1155 for multi-token standard on the VechainThor Network, please refer to the documentation [here](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-1155.md).

## 1. Introduction

> The VIP-210 is equivalent to ERC1155 in the Vechain ecosystem.

The VIP-210 token standard provides a way to make one smart contract govern almost an unlimited number of tokens — technically, 2^256 token types with up to 2^256 copies of each. Additionally, each token is semi-fungible. Unlike VIP-181 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can only be owned by one address each, semi-fungible means:

+ Each token type can be owned by multiple addresses.
+ One address can own multiple copies of each token.


## 2. Rationale

Tokens standards like VIP-180 and VIP-181 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address.

New functionality is possible with this design such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible token types in a single contract.


## 3. Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Smart contracts implementing the VIP-210 standard MUST implement all of the functions in the VIP210 interface.

### VIP-210 Token Receiver

Smart contracts MUST implement all of the functions in the VIP210TokenReceiver interface to accept transfers. See `Safe Transfer Rules` for further detail.


    pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

    interface IVIP210TokenReceiver {
        /**
            @notice Handle the receipt of a single VIP210 token type.
            @dev An VIP210-compliant smart contract MUST call this function on the token recipient contract, at the end of a `safeTransferFrom` after the balance has been updated.        
            This function MUST return `bytes4(keccak256("onVIP210Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,string)"))` (i.e. 0xeae23ab4) if it accepts the transfer.
            This function MUST revert if it rejects the transfer.
            Return of any other value than the prescribed keccak256 generated value MUST result in the transaction being reverted by the caller.
            @param _operator  The address which initiated the transfer (i.e. msg.sender)
            @param _from      The address which previously owned the token
            @param _id        The ID of the token being transferred
            @param _value     The amount of tokens being transferred
            @param _data      Additional data with no specified format
            @return           `bytes4(keccak256("onVIP210Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,string)"))`
        */
        function onVIP210Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, string calldata _data) external returns(bytes4);

        /**
            @notice Handle the receipt of multiple VIP210 token types.
            @dev An VIP210-compliant smart contract MUST call this function on the token recipient contract, at the end of a `safeBatchTransferFrom` after the balances have been updated.        
            This function MUST return `bytes4(keccak256("onVIP210BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],string)"))` (i.e. 0x004ac0e7) if it accepts the transfer(s).
            This function MUST revert if it rejects the transfer(s).
            Return of any other value than the prescribed keccak256 generated value MUST result in the transaction being reverted by the caller.
            @param _operator  The address which initiated the batch transfer (i.e. msg.sender)
            @param _from      The address which previously owned the token
            @param _ids       An array containing ids of each token being transferred (order and length must match _values array)
            @param _values    An array containing amounts of each token being transferred (order and length must match _ids array)
            @param _data      Additional data with no specified format
            @return           `bytes4(keccak256("onVIP210BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],string)"))`
        */
        function onVIP210BatchReceived(address _operator, address _from, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, string calldata _data) external returns(bytes4);       
    }


#### Safe Transfer Rules

To be more explicit about how the standard safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom functions MUST operate with respect to the VIP210TokenReceiver hook functions.


### Metadata

The URI value allows for ID substitution by clients. For VIP210 assets, your contract will need to return a URI where we can find the metadata. To find this URI, we use the uri method in VIP210. 

    function uri(uint256 _id) public view returns (string memory) {
        return Strings.strConcat(baseMetadataURI, Strings.uint2str(_id));
    }


The uri function in your VIP210 contract should return an HTTP or IPFS URL. When queried, this URL should in turn return a JSON blob of data with the metadata for your token.


#### Metadata URI JSON Schema

This JSON schema is loosely based on the "VIP181 Metadata JSON Schema", but includes optional formatting to allow for ID substitution by clients. 

    {
        "title": "Token Metadata",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The name of this token"
            },
            "symbol": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The symbol of this token"
            },
            "decimals": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "The number of decimal places that the token amount should display - e.g. 18, means to divide the token amount by 1000000000000000000 to get its user representation."
            },
            "description": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Describes the asset to which this token represents"
            },
            "image": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this token represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
            },
            "properties": {
                "type": "object",
                "description": "Arbitrary properties. Values may be strings, numbers, object or arrays."
            }
        }
    }

An example of an VIP210 Metadata JSON file follows. The properties array proposes some SUGGESTED formatting for token-specific display properties and metadata.

    {
        "name": "Asset Name",
        "description": "Some descriptions",
        "image": "https://token-cdn-domain/images/1.png",
        "properties": {
            "simple_property": "example value",
            "array_property": {
                "name": "Name",
                "value": [1,2,3,4],
                "class": "emphasis"
            }
        }
    }

#### Localization

Metadata localization should be standardized to increase presentation uniformity across all languages. As such, a simple overlay method is proposed to enable localization. If the metadata JSON file contains a localization attribute, its content MAY be used to provide localized values for fields that need it. The localization attribute should be a sub-object with three attributes: uri, default and locales. If the `locale` exists in any URI query parameter, it MUST be replaced with the chosen locale by all client software, such as https://token-cdn-domain/tokens/1?locale=en
