VeChain Improvement Proposals
====

VIP stands for VeChain Improvement Proposal. It is a design document providing information, or describing a new feature. The VIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature.

The VIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

### Formats and Templates

Each VIP should have the following parts:

+ Header: The metadata about the VIP, including the VIP number, title and the author. See [Header Preamble](#Header Preamble) for details.
+ Overview: A short description of the technical issue being addressed.
+ Rationale: The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made.
+ Specification: The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.


### Header Preamble

### Category

There are four kinds of VIP:

+ Core: Improvements requiring a consensus fork
+ Application: Application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards
+ Interface: Improvements around client API specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names and contract ABIs
+ Information: Describes a design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the community, but does not propose a new feature


## Status Terms

+ Draft: A VIP in draft status must be implemented to be considered for promotion to the next status.
+ Accepted: A VIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
+ Deferred: A VIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.
+ Withdrawn: A VIP editor may consider to withdraw the proposal for some reasons.
+ Final: This VIP represents the current state-of-the-art. A Final VIP should only be updated to correct errata.
